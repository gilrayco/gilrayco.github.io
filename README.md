>Ride The Cyclone is a musical (and book) by Jacob Richmond and Brooke Maxwell. It is the second installment in Richmond's "Uranium Teen Scream Trilogy" (even though only two have been written as of the date above) which all take place in Uranium City. 
>
>This second story is about the recently deceased St. Cassian High School chamber choir of Uranium City. These six teens died after riding the doomed Fall Fair ride, "The Cyclone" and have been offered a second chance at life by The Amazing Karnak, a mechanical fortune teller. (the very mechanical fortune teller that told them to ride The Cyclone in the first place!)

> "Ever since I was six years old, I knew I wasn't long for this world. Unlike the other kids, I was always in a place to face that realm called outer space. Thank you, Lady Marzipan. Thank you, Dame Judi Dench. It appears your loyal service is no longer necessary in this stratosphere. Game on."

> # 6. *Jane Doe*
> "When a lioness has children, she stops making love to the lion. The lion gets jealousâ€”sometimes so jealous he eats the children. You'd think this would upset the lioness. Far from it. They make love again like the children never existed. I find that idea terrifying."
